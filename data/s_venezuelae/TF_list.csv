After 18 hr, the density at OD450 was measured and the developmental progression of each strain was monitored by light microscopy. A 1 mL sample was then taken for immunoblot analysis, and an 80 mL sample was transferred to a sterile flask. Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1% (vol/vol) to cross-link protein to DNA, after which cultures were incubated for a further 30 min. Glycine was then added to a final concentration of 125 mM.",,R1,SRR7282569.bw,R2,SRR7282569.bw,,,,,,,,,,,,
