Following the procedure described in Nieselt et al. (23), we inoculated thawed spore stock (2,5*10∧9/ml CFU—typically 3 ml) to 100 ml 2YT medium (bacto tryptone, 16 g/l; bacto-yeast extract, 10 g/l; NaCl, 5 g/l) to 500 ml Erlenmeyer’s flask (customised to enable aeration) and germinated at 30°C for 5 h. The germinated spores were harvested by centrifugation (3200 × g, 15°C, 5 min) and resuspended in 5 ml ion-free water. Then they were inoculated into an 1.8l Na-glutamate medium (Na-glutamate, 61 g/l; glucose monohydrate, 44 g/l; MgSO4, 2.0 mM; Na2HPO4, 2.3 mM; KH2PO4, 2.3 mM) supplemented with 8 ml/l of trace element solution (ZnSO4 x 7 H2O, 0.1 g/l; FeSO4 × 7 H2O, 0.1 g/l; MnCl2 × 4 H2O, 0.1 g/l, CaCl2 × 6H2O,0,1 g/l, NaCl 0,1 g/l) (22) and 5.6 ml/l of TMS1 (FeSO4 × 7 H2O, 5 g/l; CuSO4 × 5 H2O, 390 mg/l; ZnSO4 × 7H2O, 440 mg/l; MnSO4 × H2O, 150 mg/l; Na2MoO4 × 2H2O, 10 mg/l; CoCl2 × 6 H2O, 20 mg/l; HCl, 50ml/l). Cultivation was conducted at 30°C at 250 RPM and pH of 7 was maintained during growth. Samples for the ChIP-seq analysis were collected after 22 h (equivalent to exponential phase) of growth (23).",,R1,ERR2639621.bw,R2,ERR2639622.bw,,,,,,,,,,,,
