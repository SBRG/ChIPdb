The strain was frequently re-isolated from experimentally infected hamsters to maintain its virulence, as described (26). We used a protocol for irradiation with short wavelength ultraviolet light (UV-C) that has been described elsewhere (21). Briefly, cultures of exponentially growing bacteria were either exposed (IR) or not exposed (NI) to a UV-C germicidal lamp (254 nm), at a dose known to kill 50–60% of cells (5 J.m−2). After treatment, the same volume of fresh medium was added to both cultures to stimulate cellular growth and they were incubated at 30°C for 12 h. For ciprofloxacin treatment, 5 μg/ml antibiotic was added to the cultures, which were incubated for 4 h or 12 h. Next, cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000xg, 15 min) and pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use. All procedures were performed in the dark and repeated for four different biological samples.",,,,R1,SRR2549977.bw,R2,SRR2549979.bw,,,,,,,,,,,,
