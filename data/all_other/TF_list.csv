Following the procedure described in Nieselt et al.

The germinated spores were harvested by centrifugation (3200 × g, 15°C, 5 min) and resuspended in 5 ml ion-free water. Then they were inoculated into an 1.8l Na-glutamate medium (Na-glutamate, 61 g/l; glucose monohydrate, 44 g/l; MgSO4, 2.0 mM; Na2HPO4, 2.3 mM; KH2PO4, 2.3 mM) supplemented with 8 ml/l of trace element solution (ZnSO4 x 7 H2O, 0.1 g/l; FeSO4 × 7 H2O, 0.1 g/l; MnCl2 × 4 H2O, 0.1 g/l, CaCl2 × 6H2O,0,1 g/l, NaCl 0,1 g/l) (22) and 5.6 ml/l of TMS1 (FeSO4 × 7 H2O, 5 g/l; CuSO4 × 5 H2O, 390 mg/l; ZnSO4 × 7H2O, 440 mg/l; MnSO4 × H2O, 150 mg/l; Na2MoO4 × 2H2O, 10 mg/l; CoCl2 × 6 H2O, 20 mg/l; HCl, 50ml/l).

The strain was frequently re-isolated from experimentally infected hamsters to maintain its virulence, as described (26). We used a protocol for irradiation with short wavelength ultraviolet light (UV-C) that has been described elsewhere (21). Briefly, cultures of exponentially growing bacteria were either exposed (IR) or not exposed (NI) to a UV-C germicidal lamp (254 nm), at a dose known to kill 50–60% of cells (5 J.m−2). After treatment, the same volume of fresh medium was added to both cultures to stimulate cellular growth and they were incubated at 30°C for 12 h. For ciprofloxacin treatment, 5 μg/ml antibiotic was added to the cultures, which were incubated for 4 h or 12 h. Next, cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000xg, 15 min) and pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until use.
