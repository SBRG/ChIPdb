# Venn and BS Table Notes 
A few notes to be aware of since my last edit/push (Friday June 4th, 2021 @ 5:50)
1.	Two of the yTF (YjdC and YdcI) have no regulon data within Precise2 TRN; hence why there are two empty venn diagrams.
      This needs to be checked by Ye.
2.  All but one yTF (YiaG) have been processed to create binding site tables and venn diagrams. This is because there 
    is a bug when creating the dataset for the table for YiaG.
    
3.  The color of the venn diagram for a case when a regulon is completely captured by chip data, or vice versa, 
    needs fixing.
    
4.  Still waiting for curated data for other TFs 
5.  Need to review the accuracy of the code in capturing genetic targets.
